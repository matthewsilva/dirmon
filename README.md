# Monitoring Instructions

You'll need to restart your system to begin monitoring (because dirmon is now set up as a startup service with cron)

Enter each directory you would like to monitor into /etc/dirmon/monitored_directories , one per line

# Viewing File Access Events

See the result of your auditing in /etc/dirmon/audit_file (feel free to remove this file if you want to clear out old info)

# Dirmon Options

You can run dirmon --help in a terminal to see the format for running the dirmon command.

Feel free to edit /etc/dirmon/dirmon_service to specify which events you would like to be recorded. All types of file access are recorded by default.
